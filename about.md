# Deltarune Textboxes

## This mod turns every <cb>Popup</c> into a <cr>Deltarune</c> styled textbox!

You can <cj>advance</c> the text by pressing <cy>Z</c>, <cy>Enter</c> or by </cy>tapping</c>/</cy>clicking</c> on the screen!

You can <cj>skip</c> the text by pressing <cy>X</c>, <cy>Space</c> or by <cy>tapping</c>/<cy>clicking</c> while the text rolls out!

You can <cj>change the keybinds</c> with the <cj>Custom Keybinds</c> mod!

If you want to suggest a feature, create an issue on github or ping me on discord (@timestepyt)
